When developing your game, make sure to add the GameControllerDevelop prefab to any scenes where you'll use the following
methods and/or properties.

You can call these functions in any script at any time:

Functions you can call:

GameController.Instance.WinGame() will tell the GameController that the player has won the game.

GameController.Instance.LoseGame() will tell the GameController that the player has lost the game.

GameController.Instance.SetMaxTimer(float time) can only be called ONCE, BEFORE the game starts (so put this in an active object's Start
function somewhere). It's used to set the maximum amount of time a player has before losing the game. You can set the maximum amount of time 
to a minimum of 5 seconds and a maximum of 20 seconds.


Properties you can access (these are read-only, you cannot modify them):

GameController.Instance.gameDifficulty can either be 1, 2, or 3, and is meant to signify the current level of difficulty.

GameController.Instance.gameTime tells you the amount of seconds that have passed since the game has started. If gameTime reaches
20 seconds, player will automatically lose the game.

GameController.Instance.timerOn will tell you if the timer is currently on.


Properties you can access (these can be written AND read):

GameController.Instance.gamePoints is the current number of points the player has.


Fairly useless properties that you can still read anyways:

GameController.Instance.maxFails is the number of times that a player can lose before it's game over.

GameController.Instance.gameFails is the number of times the player has lost games.

GameController.Instance.gameWins is the number of times the player has won games.
